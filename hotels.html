		<h2>SANTHANI</h2>
			<p>
Named for the Sanskrit word meaning “in harmony with,” Santanit is the first and only purpose-built wellness resort in Sri Lanka and realises the sincere belief that sustainable wellness begins by bringing oneself into balance with nature and by allowing ourselves to receive nurture from ourselves as well as from others. Offering effective, meaningful wellness without artifice, Santani has a pure and simple purpose: to help you get unstuck. This 48-acre former tea plantation within a pristine forest now functions as a restorative destination spa, which is completely accessible yet blissfully secluded. The 18 rooms are built for natural ventilation and are air-condition free. Guests are free to roam around the tropical jungle and fertile rice fields, to practice yoga or to meditate along the Hulu River. <br>

		<h2> AMANWELLA</h2>
			<p>

On Sri Lanka’s sun-baked south coast near the fishing town of Tangalle, Amanwella lies amid 37 acres of coconut trees next to a perfect crescent of golden sand. The resort derives its name by combining the words, aman, or “peace” in Sanskrit, and wella, the Sinhalese name for beach. Combining modernist lines and indigenous materials, guest suites are inspired by the work of famed Sri Lankan architect Geoffrey Bawa; flooded with light, they each open on two sides to private plunge pools and large terraces overlooking the Indian Ocean. Away from the palm-shaded private beach club and the olympic sized pool, the area’s diverse attractions – from tea plantations to treks and temple visits – capture Sri Lanka at its most authentic. Amanwella is managed by Aman, the world’s most exclusive hotel brand.
