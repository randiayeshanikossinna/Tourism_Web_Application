   	<div class="detalis">
   		<p style="font-size: 17px;">Sri Lanka is second to none in terms of its biodiversity and can be considered the best for big game safaris outside the African continent. As bold a statement as that may be, Sri Lanka’s wildlife credentials speak for itself.
   		<br>Sri Lanka’s Big Five – leopard, elephant, sloth bear, blue whale, and sperm whale – are known as the country’s great wildlife attractions. These species are just some of the country’s plethora of wild species of fauna. It is also renowned as a birder’s paradise with an array of endemic, migratory, and resident avifauna found in its 70 Important Bird Areas strewn across its diverse landscape. Sri Lanka is also famous for its abundance of exotic flora.

<br>Amongst its many wildlife attractions, none have garnered such awe as those pertaining to the largest land mammal in the world – the elephant. Sri Lanka is home to the largest seasonally recurring concentration of wild elephants found anywhere in the world. This phenomenon known simply as The Gathering takes place in the country’s Minneriya National Park which is renowned the world over for being one of the best locations to spot elephant herds and observe their behaviour. Herds as large as 400 elephants have been recorded here in the past. Lonely Planet listed this occurrence as one of the Top Ten Wildlife Spectacles in the world. Sri Lankan elephants can also be spotted in several of the country’s 26 national parks including the Udawalawe National Park which is the only place in the world that guarantees an elephant sighting on each visit.
Sri Lanka’s wildlife crown jewel is the Sri Lankan leopard. Yala National Park is celebrated as the best place on Earth to see leopards as its leopard density is unmatched. Block 1 has a leopard for every square kilometre and these usually reclusive beasts are often spotted in these parts. Apart from the leopard, Sri Lanka is also home to other wildcats including jungle cats, civet cats, and rusty-spotted cats that can be found in Sri Lanka’s wilds.

<br>The sloth bear is somewhat more elusive and its dwindling numbers have meant that spotting them in the wild is a rarity. However, in places such as Wasgamuwa National Park, Wilpattu National Park, and Yala, visitors have been able to catch a glimpse of these magnificent bears, especially during the Palu Season during which these marvellous mammals can be seen climbing the palu trees to gorge themselves on their favourite fruity snacks.
The island is also considered the best place in the world to spot the largest animal that has ever lived on earth – the blue whale. The coastlines of Mirissa and Trincomalee offer the best locations for viewing these magnificent beasts while Kalpitiya is known as one of the world’s top ten best sites to catch a glimpse of the amazing sperm whale – the biggest toothed whale in the world. Meanwhile, Mirissa additionally offers visitors the best chance at seeing both these magnificent mammals of the ocean on the same tour.

<br>Sri Lanka is also an amazing place to visit for those interested in birding. It has dozens of bird sanctuaries and Important Bird Areas where an eye-catching array of avifauna can be viewed. The Kumana and Bundala National Parks are birding hotspots where almost every species of bird recorded in Sri Lanka can be seen. The Sinharaja Bird Wave is also a well-known attraction in Sri Lanka, providing visitors with the largest and longest studied bird waves on the island.

The wildlife of Sri Lanka is one of the country’s defining attractions and few countries can rival Sri Lankan wildlife and its combination of big game safari animals, species densities, and its tourism infrastructure. It is well and truly the ultimate safari island.</p>

   		 <h2>YALA NATIONAL PARK</h2>
   		  <p style="font-size: 20px;">Yala Park is the 2nd largest wildlife park in Sri Lanka. The climate here is semi-arid with vast dry woodlands and open patches of grasslands and is divided into five blocks. Jeep Safari tour through the wildlife Park will be an unforgettable adventure, along with an odd chance of being charged at by a juvenile bull elephant! But as one will find out soon it’s part of the daily routine of a young bull elephant and quite harmless. Park also includes wide varieties of wildlife and plants. Two large rivers flow through the park and are home to about 32 species of mammals, 125 species of birds, along with many reptiles and lagoon fauna species. The entrance fees are payable at the main entrance office and includes the services of a tracker. In our opinion Yala National park is the best place to see peafowl’s in their best suits, monkeys chattering through the bush, elephants trumpeting through the undergrowth, elusive Sri Lankan leopards (Panthera pardus kotiya) gliding soundlessly through the bush hunting for their next meal, end of the dry season is the best time to see the animals around shrinking water holes.</p>

The gathering is documented as the largest known meeting place of Asian Elephants in the world. During the dry season of August to September each year, herds up to 300 elephants are seen within a few square kilometers of the vast Minneriya Reservoir. This Elephant Gathering is a thrilling spectacle that would be remembered for rest of the life of all those who were fortunate enough to witness it. 24 species of mammals and over 170 species of birds have been recorded here and out Of the 25 species of reptiles recorded in the park 8 are endemic.

Safari camping in Sri Lanka is an ideal way to savour the splendour of the island from one of the many spots available for such camps. The game reserves of Sri Lanka are best savoured from such a camp than trudging up and down from a hotel! You may select a tour from a wide range of tours or enjoy one tailor made just for you. Observing nature and its diversity is best done in our opinion in one such camps, whether its fauna, flora, bird watching or even interacting with the local indigenous people “Veddha’s”.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

   	    <h2 style="font-size: 20px;">Horton Plains National Park</h2>
   	    <p>The Horton Plains National Park at Ohiya is a beautiful highland plateau situated at an elevation of 2100 -2300m (6,900-7,500ft) above sea level. Sri Lanka’s Highlands along with Horton Plains National Park, the Peak Wilderness Protected Area and the Knuckles Conservation Forest was declared a World Heritage site in 2006.It is accessible via Ginigathena (185.4 km) or via the A5 Road (228.5 km) which connects Peradeniya with Chenkalady in the east via Gampola & Nuuwara Eliya.

Horton plains has an interesting history behind it with the discovery of early stone tools dating back to the Balangoda Culture (According to Archeological sequences the earliest evidence of Balangoda Man at caves and other sites dates back to 38,000 BP).

The weather at the plains varies considerably during the course of the day with temperatures as high as 27 degrees centigrade during the day and dipping as low as 5 degrees centigrade in the evenings and night with thick mist formation and regular rainfall throughout the year.

This protected area situated in the southern plateau of the central highlands of Sri Lanka was formerly called ‘Maha-Eliya Tenna’ (The great open plains) until it was renamed ‘Horton Plains’ after the British Governor of Ceylon Sir Robert Wilmot Horton (1831-1837). It is rich in biodiversity with many species endemic to the area itself. Horton Plains was designated a National Park in 1988 and is today a very important and popular tourist destination.

The Horton Plains vegetation is classified into two distinctive groups, mostly consisting of montane grasslands and lesser sub tropical montane evergreen cloud forests. It is also where two important peaks Kirigalpoththa and Thotupolakanda, the second and third highest peaks in the country respectively are situated, making it a key catchment area of three major rivers in the country. Close to 750 species of plants have been observed here; this includes dwarf bamboo species (some endemic to Sri Lanka), Myrtaceae and Lauraceae species, and many varieties of ferns, lichens and orchids amongst others. The fauna of the region includes 24 species of mammals, 87 species of birds, 09 species of reptiles, 15 species of amphibians and 02 species of fish.

Of the mammals the most commonly seen are the Sambar deer with a population close to 2000. Others include Toque macaques, Purple faced langur, Kelaart’s long-clawed shrews, Sri Lankan Leopard, Wild boa; Strip necked mongoose, Spotted chevrotain, Giant squirrels, Fishing cat and one of the world’s most endangered primates, the Red slender loris.

The park is also considered a very important birding area in Sri Lanka containing 21 endemic bird species such as Sri Lanka Superfowl, Sri Lanka Junglefowl, Yellow-fronted barbet, Orange-billed babbler, Sri Lanka bush warbler and Sri Lanka Whistling thrush, with four species namely the Sri Lanka Magpie, Dull-blue flycatcher, Sri Lanka White-eye and Sri Lanka Wood pigeon which occur only in Horton Plains. There are also a variety of migrant birds such as the Alpine swift, Crested serpent eagle, Mountain-hawk eagle and Black-winged kite. Amongst the reptile species are the Rhino horn lizard, the Common rough sided snake and rat snake.

However the beauty of Horton Plains is its beautiful, picturesque setting. The high altitude plains with its cold breeze, misty surroundings, beautiful mountains, tall green trees, crystal clear streams and colourful blooms scattered around, besides the ‘World’s End’ – a 700m vertical drop that gives a marvelous view of the valley below and the beautiful cascades of the Baker’s waterfall makes it a haven for trekking and bird watching.</p><br><br>

   	    <h2>Lunugamvehera National Park</h2>
   	    <p>Lunugamvehera located in the Monaragala district in the Uva Province, is 261 km from Colombo and is accessible via Tissamaharama in the Southern province or via Kalawana in the Sabaragamuwa province.

The Park was established in 1995 with the intent of establishing an important catchment area for the Lunugamvehera Reservoir and as a sanctuary for the wildlife in the area. The park also acts as an elephant corridor between the Yala National Park on the east and the Udawalawe National Park on the west, facilitating the animals to move from one to the other, in addition to providing a favourable habitat for Elephants coming from the nearby Uva and Southern regions, making it a preferred destination for Elephant sighting.

The Park with a dry mixed dense evergreen forest is made up mainly of Weera, Pallu, Teak, Eucalyptus, Kon amongst others, vast expanses of grasslands and scrublands, in total covering an extent of 23,498 ha of which 3,283 ha is occupied by the Lunugamvehera reservoir. The park is rich in biodiversity and is a favaourable habitat for large herds of Elephants, Wild Buffalo in addition to 43 species of mammals such as Wild Boar, Sambar deer, Spotted deer, Sri Lankan Axis deer, Fishing cat, Asian Palm civet, Grey mongoose, Grizzled Giant squirrel, Sloth bear and Mouse deer. The park is also home to 21 species of fish, 12 amphibians and 33 species of reptiles.

   	    <h2>Kadulla National Park</h2>

   	    <p>Kaudulla National Park, 6,900 hectares in extent, is one of the more recently established National Parks in Sri Lanka. It is situated 197 km from the City of Colombo, in the North Central Province, just 30km away from Polonnaruwa. The wildlife sanctuary was designated a National Park in 2002 and serves as a elephant corridor for migrating Elephants from Minneriya and Wasgamuwa National Parks in the north central and the Somawathiya National Park in the north east regions.

Kaudulla is historically important as it is one of the famed 16 irrigation tanks built by King Mahasen in 1959. The park mainly consists of a mix of dry scrub forest and grasslands. The tank which dominates the background of the Park is an important meeting place for hundreds of species of wildlife which popularly includes hundreds of Elephants who come to water at the reservoir, especially during the dry seasons. Others include 24 species of mammals such as Sambar deer, Axis deer, Monkeys, Wild boar, Chevrotain, Sloth bear and the more elusive Leopard and Grey slender loris. Birdlife International has recognized Kaudula National Park as an important bird area, where 160 of species of birds have been identified; some of them are Spot-billed pelican, Lesser adjutant, Asian spoonbill, Grey-headed fish eagle, Black-headed ibis, Painted and open-billed storks, Peacock and the Giant eagle. However the photographer’s favourite are the thousands of pelicans flocked together enjoying the water at sunset. Also identified here are 26 species of fish which include Oreochromis mossambicus, 25 species of reptiles; Freshwater turtles such as the Indian Flap-shelled turtle and Indian black turtle and an endemic species of amphibian - Fejervaryapulla.

The best time to visit the park is between August and December, particularly during September and October when the largest gathering of Elephants can be witnessed. Visitors also have the opportunity to take a memorable paddle boat ride across the reservoir, an excellent means of observing birds at close range.Located in the district of Matale, between Polnnaruwa and Habarana, 225 km away from Colombo, Wasgamuwa is the best place to observe Elephants. The nearest large town is Polonnaruwa, 10 km from the northern boundary. The best time to enjoy the sight of large herds is during November to May. In the rest of the year the elephants tend to migrate to nearby Minneriya and Kaudulla National Parks. Other wildlife includes Purple faced langur monkeys, wild boar, sambar and spotted deer, buffalo and rarely sighted leopards and sloth bears. Among the reptiles are water monitor, mugger crocodile, estuarine crocodile and python.</p><br><br><br>

   	    <h2> Sinharaja Forest Reserve Sri Lanka</h2>
   	    <p>Sinharaja Forest Reserve meaning ‘Lion Kingdom’ is the best known Rain Forest in the country and has been identified as important biodiversity hotspot. The Park was originally declared a forest reserve in 1875 and due to its international importance it was designated as a Biosphere Reserve in 1978 and a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1988.

It is situated 172.1 km from Colombo via the Southern Expressway and is accessible from any of its three entrances; Pitadeniya, Kudawa and Morning Side. The vegetation at Sinharaja is that of a tropical wet evergreen forest with large trees that grow to heights of 35m to 40m and even going up to 50m, believed to have unbelievable genetic potential, waiting to be tapped. Some families of Dipterocarpaceae show an endemism of over 90%, of the 211 woody trees and lianas, 66% or 139 of them are endemic to the forest reserve. The lower plants such as Ferns and epiphytes of the 25 endemic species 13 have been recorded within Sinharaja itself.

The secondary forest type is mainly made up of minor forest and scrub brought about by human activity. The forest reserve benefits from both monsoon rainfalls - the south-west between May-July and north-east between November-January each year. The average temperature recorded is between 18-27 degrees centigrade, with February being the only dry month experienced in the park.

The forest reserve recognized as a living heritage, though relatively smaller than other National Parks, it extends over an area of 11,187 hectares, bordering the three districts of Galle, Matara and Ratnapura. The forest reserve receives an annual rainfall of 3000-6000 mm throughout the year. Two important rivers; namely the Gin and Kalu Ganga (Rivers) and many other waterways are fed and nourished by the waters that flow from thisverdent forest reserve. The forest cover is denser than other dry zone parks making it more secure for the wildlife yet making it a little harder for visitors to take a glimpse of the larger mammals such as the Leopard and Elephants.

This tropical rain forest believed to be home for almost 50% of Sri Lanka’s endemic wildlife draws thousands of visitors wanting to explore and experience this natural wonder that is rich in endemism; an inevitable treasure trove bursting with various species of flora and fauna.

The high diversity of vegetation within the reserve has made it a favorable sanctuary for various species of birds, mammals, reptiles, insects, fish, amphibians and plant life; all co-existing within the ecosystem.

The larger mammals are the Elephants (only few seen on the Rakwana side) Leopard, Sambar, Fishing Cat, Rusty Spotted Cat, Barking deer, Mouse deer, Jackal and Wild boar and the commonly seen endemic Purple-faced langur and the Toque macaque, a reddish brown monkey. The smaller mammals include, Porcupine, Otter, three types of squirrels; Giant, Small striped and Flying, two species of Mongoose- the Badger and Brown, two species of Civets; Ring-tailed and Golden Palm, many species of Bandicoot, Rats, Bats and even the very rare Pangolin. Some of the reptiles are Python, Green pit viper, the Hump-nosed viper and Rough-nosed horned lizard. It is known that 50% of the endemic amphibian species of the country are found in Sinharaja; this includes Greater hour-glass tree frog, Wrinkled frog, Reed frog and the Torrent toad.

Sinharaja has recorded over 154 species of birds and is known to have a ‘mixed-species feeding flocks’ or informally called a ‘bird wave’ where two or more species feed and move together. This unique sight witnessed at Sinharaja sometimes consists of flocks containing 30-50 birds of various species sometimes 10-12 species, erupting in various bird sounds as they feed and move within a short time. Taking lead in this exercise is the Orange-billed babbler and the Crested drongo.

The endemic birds witnessed here include Ceylon Lorikeet, Layard’s parakeet, Jungle & Spur fowl, Sri Lanka Blue magpie, Sri Lanka Grackle, Ceylon Hanging parrot, Ceylon Grey hornbill, Ashy-headed laughing thrush, Layard’s parakeet, Spotted-wing thrush, Brown-capped babbler, Ceylon Hill mynah, Red faced malkoha, Legge’s flower-pecker amongst many others.</p><br><br>

   	    <h2>Knuckles forest Reserve</h2>
   	    <p>The Knuckles Mountain Range also called the Knuckles Massif; a bio-diversity hotspot located in the districts of Kandy and Matale in the Central Province of Sri Lanka. Situated at a height of over 3000 ft above sea level, covering a land area of approximately 21 ha it consists of five peaks; namely Kirigalpottha, Gombaniya, Knuckles, Koboneelagala and Dotulugala which form the shape of the knuckles in a clenched fist. The area situated above 1500 m was declared a climatic reserve in 1873 and a conservation forest in 2000, later a National Man & Biosphere Reserve and a World Heritage Site in 2009. It is today considered as one of South Asia’s important sites for the conservation of montane tropical forest habitats.

This picturesque mist laden mountain range is where the Knuckles Forest Reserve also known as the Knuckles Conservation forest is found. It is an UNESCO designated World Heritage Site that comes under the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka’s World Heritage Property, one of the two World Heritage Natural Properties in Sri Lanka.

The climate here varies from hot to very wet and cold with some higher elevations reporting ground frost during January – March with strong winds at most other times. The vegetation in the valleys and foothills consist mainly of semi evergreen vegetation with large trees, the upper slopes contain tropical montane humid evergreen rain forest and the upper levels possess cloud forests; a moist forest with a low-level cloud cover where various endemic species of ferns, orchids, lichens and mosses grow profusely. The other types of unique vegetation found here includes the distinctively beautiful grasslands called “Pitawala Patana”, the picturesque Riverine forests alongside the rivers and waterways, the Scrublands and the Pygmy forests with its twisted and gnarled plant life that grow up to 1-2 m from ground level.

The Knuckles massif separates itself from the central hills by the Dumbara Valley; a deep gorge. There are several trails to the Knuckles Mountain range, each one different and exclusive, making it ideal for hiking, trekking, waterfall hunting, bird watching and certainly a must place for some scenic photography. Visitors can travel on three routes from Kandy via Rattota, via Wattegama and via Teldeniya.

The Knuckles Forest reserve is considered a vital water catchment with many of its streams feeding important downstream rivers such as the gigantic Mahaweli River (the country’s longest), the Heen River, Maha Oya, Hasalaka Oya and the Theligamu Oya.

The Forest Reserve has recorded up of 1033 plant species belonging to 141 families of which 15% are endemic. In addition there are 128 bird species of which 17 are endemic; some of them are the Black eagle, Pale billed flower pecker, Barbets, Lorikeets, Egrets, Herons, Bulbuls, Babblers, Kingfishers and Wood peckers. The 31 mammal species include the Wild boar, Black-naped hare, Mouse deer, Sambar deer, Elephant, Wild buffalo, Monkey, Squirrel, Civet cat, Golden palm cat, Loris, Jackal, Mongoose, Bandicoot and Porcupine. The 20 amphibians’ species include the Kirthisingha’s Rock Frog and the Leaf nosed lizard, 15 species of fish include the Phillips Garra, Blotched filamented barb and Martenstyn barb. There are 60 species of butterflies, with two endemic species the Birdwing and the Blue Mormon. There are also 17 species of mollusks and 53 species of reptiles.</p>

   	    <h2>KItulgala Forest Reserve</h2>
   	    <p>The scenic and serene village of Kitulgala is situated west of Sri Lanka, 95 km from Colombo on the Colombo-Avissawella- Hatton Road in the Sabaragamuwa Province. From Colombo, Kitulgala can be reached via the Colombo-Avissawela- Ruwanwella route. Kitulgala is where the famous film “The Bridge over the River Kwai” the World War II epic film directed by David Lean was filmed.

Being situated in the wet zone Kitulgala receives rainfall from two monsoons every year, giving the region its lush green vegetation, verdant mountains and the impressive Kelani River’s cascading waters.

The Kitulgala Forest Reserve (Makandawa Forest Reserve) covering 1,155 ha was established with the objective of protecting the catchment of the Kelani River. It is a secondary lowland rainforest gradually moving towards higher elevations and is accessible by crossing the Kelani River by boat (usually a traditional dugout canoe with an outrigger) and it is sometimes possible to wade across during the dry seasons. The forest reserve with its rain forest habitat, similar to the Sinharaja Rain Forest is home to many endemic species of fauna and flora, in addition to scenic waterfalls; such as the Makulu Ella and Lenakiri Ella.

The bird species found here include 54 rare species; this includes the Green billed coucal, the Chestnut-backed owlet, Yellow-fronted barbet, Ceylon jungle & spur fowl, Layard’s parakeet, Ceylon lorikeet, Ceylon rufous babbler, Red faced malkoha, Ceylon blue magpie, Sri Lanka spot-winged thrush, Grey hornbill, Common hill mynah in addition to the newly discovered Serendip Scops Owl and many migrant waders who visit the forest reserve during the migration season. The mammals commonly seen here are the Grizzled-tailed giant squirrel and the rarely seen Red slender loris.</p>

   	    <h2>Anawilundawa Bird Sanctuary</h2>
   	    <p>The Anawilundawa Bird Sanctuary is situated in the Puttalam district in the North Western province of the country; between Chilaw and Puttlam – to be more specific - it is situated between the coast and the Chilaw-Puttlam railway line.

The uniqueness of Anawilundawa is its immediate proximity to three vastly different ecosystems; the coast, the mangroves and the fresh water tanks making it one of the six RAMSAR Wetlands in Sri Lanka. This unique ecological setting has made it a favourable nesting and breeding ground for hundreds of species of birds.

It is set out on 1,397 hectares of forest land and comprises of nine tanks; six giant manmade cascading tanks namely Pinkattiya, Maradansola, Anawilundawa, Mayyawa, Surawila and Vellawali and three secondary tanks, each one connected with the other and working as one unit. These tanks store water for irrigation and cultivation and acts as a natural habitat and refuge for 150 species of water birds in addition to a few species of threatened Fish, Amphibians, Mammals, and Reptiles.

Some of the Bird species found here are a large breeding colony of Herons, the Open-bill, Great cormorant, White ibis, Egret, Stalk, Pheasant tailed jacna and the Purple swamp hen. A total of 20 species of mammals have been recorded here, this includes the Rusty spotted cat, Fishing cat, the Indian otter, Slender loris, Toque monkey and 74 species of butterflies. Most endemic and resident birds can be observed right through the year while the migrants are best seen between the months of October and April.

Anawilundawa Bird Sanctuary is a great favourite amongst bird watchers and nature lovers, who come here to spot rare birds, watch their behavior in their natural environment and indulge in some great photography.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
